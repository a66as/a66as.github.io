	<p class="intro">I am a researcher in software engineering and I blog, run, and code for fun ;)</p>
	<p>Views are my own and so are the Models and also the Controllers. (Factories are mostly auto generated!)</p>
	<h2>The academic me</h2>
	<p>I am a Researcher at <a href="https://ri.se/muhammad-abbas" target="_blank">RISE</a> ICT, Västerås and an Industrial Ph.D. student at <a href="http://www.es.mdh.se/staff/3953-Muhammad_Abbas" target="_blank">Mälardalens University</a>. My research is focused on variability modeling & testing for variant intensive cyber-physical systems. Before coming to Sweden, I was Instructor at <a href="nu.edu.pk" target="_blank">NUCES</a>, Islamabad where I taught labs of courses: Software Testing, Computer Programming, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, and Data Structures. Besides, I enjoyed Mobile/Web Applications Development during my BS(Software Engineering) at COMSATS University Islamabad, Wah Campus. I also do fun stuff such as developing Modeling Tools, and Domain-Specific Languages. Back in my MS(Software Engineering) from NUCES, Islamabad, I also worked as a Research Assistant at the Software Quality Engineering & Testing Laboratory.<br />
	A great honor throughout my academic career was working under the supervision of some great people. I am thankful to the people who supervised me, taught me and most importantly worked on my life skills. I am where I am now just because of the people who invested their valuable time on me. I am also grateful to my current Ph.D. advisors and teachers who are continuously working on polishing me for future adventures.</p>

	<h3>Rejections in my career</h3>
	<p>I believe that rejections play a very important role in shaping one's career and personality. Following are the list of rejections that I had to face:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Rejected for BS in Computer Systems Engineering, NUST, Pakistan - 2012</li>
		<li>Rejected for MS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science as an early action applicant, MIT, USA - 2015</li>

		<li>Paper Rejection in SEAA - 2019</li>
		<li>Paper Rejection in RE - 2020</li>
		<li>... and I stopped counting...</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>The real me</h2>
	<p>As a human on the planet earth, I blog, run, play badminton and take a lot of photos. I watch movies that build some connection to real life, that means I usually spend most of my time choosing a movie rather than watching one. I prefer to hike mountains (unfortunately we don't have real mountains in Sweden). I love to discuss culture, history, science, and technology. <br> My running bests:<br>
		-5k, 24:39 <br>
		-10k, 52:14 <br>
		-Half-Marathon, 1:54:44</p>
