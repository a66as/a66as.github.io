<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">B</span>logging is a good way to improve writing</p>

Ever since I started my Ph.D., I tried my best to keep writing. Well, the truth is, you can't always write papers. Writing papers is not constant during Ph.D. and thus I needed something to help me keep writing. The best way to do that is a journal (which sounds stupid, since you are the only reader) or a blog. Blog sounds more fun since you can reach millions of peeps in seconds. A nerdy way to blog is to use a nerdy blogging solution. I am a fan of the Sublime text and I wanted a way to write in that particular editor and thus GitHub Pages was an ideal choice to start with.

The blog is now up and I can keep writing in an ideal environment ;). I will try to keep the posts simple and yet interesting to read.
